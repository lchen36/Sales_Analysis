I used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

## Data Cleaning
⋅⋅* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
⋅⋅* Removing rows based on a condition
⋅⋅* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
